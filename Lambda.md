# Lambda

## What is Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service. It allows you to run codes without the help of managing servers or provisioning. You have to pay for the computing time when you consume data. There are no charges to be paid when you are not running your code. Using Lambda, you can quickly run codes for any application or backend service virtually, without any administration.
